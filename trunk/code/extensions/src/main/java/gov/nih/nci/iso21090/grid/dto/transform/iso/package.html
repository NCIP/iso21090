Provides transformers that move between the <i>DTO</i> and <i>XML</i> layers.  The most important class is
<code>Transformer</code>, which is the interface that most classes in this package implement.  It specifies
the rules for moving from DTO to XML and vice versa.

<p>The XML layer is codegened from the <code>ISO_datatypes_Narrative</code> XML schema by
<a href="http://java.sun.com/developer/technicalArticles/WebServices/jaxb/">JAXB</a>.  The stubs are generated
to the package <code>org.iso._21090</code>.  This is a standard XSD published by ISO.  The NCI has standardized
on this representation, as document on <a href="https://wiki.nci.nih.gov/display/LSCAT/ISO+21090+Data+Types">the
NCI LS CAT wiki</a>.  These are the "full" ISO data types, and are not localized in any way.

<p>The DTO layer is taken from the ISO21090 project.  See the documentation there for full details.  The most
critical information is that DTO layer is a <b>localized</b> version of the ISO data types, not a full implementation.
Therefore:
<ul>
<li>Some fields from the XML objects are not copied to the DTO layer.
<li>Translations from the DTO to XML will always leave some fields empty (Java <i>null</i>).
<li>OCL constraints at the full ISO types are respected.
</ul>
