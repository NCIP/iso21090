Steps to perform release.

1.  Check out latest code that you want to release and make sure you have no local modifications.
2.  Make sure Jira is in order with all issues in the release you want to tag marked resolved and
all other issues moved out of the release.
3.  verify that the app passes all tests by running:
mvn clean install site verify
4.  Verify that your ~/.m2 directory has a settings.xml file with the needed user name and password
to deploy to the mvn repo.
5.  run mvn release:prepare providing all information when asked.  You should usually be able to
accept the defaults for everything. Look at the repositories tag directory for the appropriate naming convention and double-check the default tag name.
    NOTE: If you are using SVN 1.5.x with Maven 2.0.8+, you may need to specify -Dusername=<svnusername> -Dpassword=<svn pass> -DtagBase=<url to tags dir>
    NOTE: If the task fails when attempting to produce the tag with a message saying a file already exists, then run 'svn up' and rerun 'mvn release:prepare'.
            This is a problem caused by a change in subversion breaking how the plugin worked.
6.  After #5 is completes successfully, run mvn release:perform
7.  Mark the version released in Jira.
