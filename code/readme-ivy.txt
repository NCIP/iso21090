To generate ivy files:

1. From this directory, run the 'ant all' task. This will generate the necessary ivy.xml files in the extensions and
   localization directories.
2. Run the 'ant convert' task in either the localization or extensions directory. This will generate the necessary 
ivy.xml file in the given directory.
