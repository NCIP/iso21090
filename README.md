Welcome to the NCI CBIIT ISO21090 Localization Common Library Project!
=====================================

The ISO 21090 Healthcare Data Type Standard provides a set of data type definitions for representing and exchanging basic concepts that are commonly encountered in healthcare environments in support of information exchange in the healthcare environment, and specifies a collection of healthcare related data types suitable for use in a number of health-related information environments.

This standard is a culmination of a large-scale joint effort among standards bodies such as HL7 and ISO, and has been reviewed by experts in the field. The standard is being adopted by Canada Health Infoway and Australia's National E-Health Transition Authority (NEHTA) as well as NCI CBIIT.

NCI CBIIT ISO 21090 Localization Common Library is an Open Source project that is a specialized and constrained version of the ISO 21090 Healthcare Data Types. Localization is the list of approved ISO 21090 data types that will be maintained by CBIIT, along with common implementation artifacts.

NCI CBIIT ISO 21090 Localization Common Library is written in Java using JAXB, Hibernate, XML technologies. It requires Ant 1.6.x and JDK 1.6.x to build. 

The goal of NCI CBIIT ISO21090 Localization Common Library is to enable round-trip development of model-driven applications and services that include ISO 21090 data types. The focus of interoperability between systems has been facilitating information sharing between data systems. Available tools also support analytical systems. Introduction of the ISO 21090 Localization Common Library has provided support for the kind of complex datatypes required by analytical systems to work efficiently with healthcare data.
